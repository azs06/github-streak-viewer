### A Node.js application to display Github streak using graphql

## Exammple usage

```bash
git clone git@github.com:azs06/github-streak-viewer.git
npm install
npm start
```

```bash
http://localhost:3002/streak/username
```

```bash
npm start:prod # To run in production mode

It uses pm2 to run in production mode. Make sure to install pm2 globally.
